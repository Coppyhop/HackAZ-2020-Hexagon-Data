		<p class="w3-padding w3-center">Boy, the US's debt sure rises fast! But has it always been that way? We invite you to explore the US's history of debt throughout the various views and graphs we provide to you. You will be able to see what presidents had the most debt increases, what party had the most debt in their terms, and even explore the spikes in historic world events. Did you know that in 1835 the US paid of all its debt? Find things like this out using the graphs here!
		Note: This data is sourced from the US Treasury itself using their APIs. Any and all data presented is factual, this site aims to take no position politically and merely just gives the data available publicly an easier to read form.</p>
