# HackAZ-2020-Hexagon-Data
A Simple Javascript project for the 2020 Hack Arizona Hackathon. This project
focuses on data visualization and analyzation of the US Debt. Using APIs
provided by the US Treasury, we are able to plot the US debt in real time as it
happens.

# Main Purpose
Educate people about the situation of the US debt, and showcasing how it has
massively inflated in recent years compared to most other times in our history.

# Tools Used
We used Plotly, Javascript, HTML, my own webserver (coppyhop.com), VSCode,
and Eclipse to create this project.
